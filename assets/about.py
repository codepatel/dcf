#### About this App
- [Inspired by Professor Aswath Damodaran's teachings and Mission](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/home.htm)
- [Prof. Damodaran's Data Sources](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datacurrent.html)
- [Prof. Damodaran's Valuation Tools Webcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA)
- [Prof. Damodaran's Valuation Spreadsheet Download link](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/fcffsimpleginzuCorona.xlsx)
- The Intrinsic Value Calculation here is not as rigorous as the spreadsheet linked above and probably over-simplified in the present version of this app. As it evolves, the App will include more features for completeness over newer releases.
